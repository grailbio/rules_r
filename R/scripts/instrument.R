# Instrument the package by adding a hook to trace its function calls, and
# adding a finalizer to save the trace to a location determined on package
# load using an environment variable. The logic here imitates covr:::add_hooks
# to some extent.

# NOTE: coverage trace counters are part of the covr namespace. We set a
# finalizer to save the trace counters on session exit, with a reasonable
# assumption that the covr package, once loaded, will not be manually
# unloaded.
