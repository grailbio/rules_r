# This test, complimenting the testthat run, checks if multiple test scripts
# are all run, and if coverage is computed accurately from multiple test runs
# in an additive manner.

# Code from //exampleA and //exampleB will have 2 hits (once here and once from
# testthat) if instrumentation filters are set to include //exampleA and
# //exampleB, and should be absent otherwise.
